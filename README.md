toolkit-povray
=========================

This is a package for the [Atom editor](https://atom.io) which add some usefull things to work with [POV-Ray](http://www.povray.org) scripts.

##Features:
- Parsing reports (use [atom-message-panel](https://github.com/tcarlsen/atom-message-panel), slightly modified)
- On save parsing and rendering

Work best under Unix, work under Windows but may work partially, add issues for problems you are encountering if you use it under Windows, will not work under Mac OS because POV-Ray does not support direct command-line options (but maybe it does?)
